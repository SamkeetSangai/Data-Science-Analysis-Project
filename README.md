Data analysis of electrical energy consumption

American Electric Power (AEP) data of 15 years from the year 2004 to 2018 was analyzed in this project which had 1,21,273 entries. Data frame had mean of  15,499.51  MW with standard deviation of 2,591.39 MW. 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of data frame are 13,630.00 MW, 15,310.00 MW and 17,200.00 MW respectively. Maximum energy was consumed during 2008-10-20 at 14:00:00 and it was 25,695.00 MW and minimum energy was consumed during 2016-10-02 at 05:00:00 and it was 9,581.00 MW. Data frame has 15 unique years from 2004 to 2018. Energy consumption in MW mostly lies in the range of 12,500.00 MW to 22,500.00 MW. Energy consumption per year is seen to be maximum between 2006  to 2008 for American Electric Power (AEP) data frame. It  was found out that energy consumption slowly increases from morning 04:00 AM and again gradually decreases at night 11:00 PM. A ‘Year vs Energy consumption plot’ was made for visualizing the energy data points of each year in successive order and it was found that most energy consumption is in the range of 14,000 MW to 18,000 MW. The following inferences can be made from the energy consumption data analysis of years 2004-06: 2006 is the year of maximum energy consumption, and on monthly basis, higher consumption trends are observed in September, October, and November. Future energy consumption of 2 months was predicted using LSTM accurately.
